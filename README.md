# cowry-shells

**in 100 characters**: a short + simple look into the use of cowry shells as binary dice -- we find that our set isn't fair!

**what**: 
- ac.pdf: analysis that confirms that our set of cowry shells (and likely others) are *truly* not fair
- ac.rmd: all code for ac.pdf
- ac_raw.txt: raw text file we collected data in
- ac.txt: cleaned up data

**why**: while playing ashta chamma over winter break, my 6-year-old cousin and i wondered if cowry shells were truly fair -- i found nothing online, and decided to introduce him to the idea of using data to learn about the world!

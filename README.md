# cowry-shells

**in 100 characters**: a short + simple look into the use of cowry shells as binary dice -- we find that our set isn't fair!

**why**: while playing ashta chamma over winter break, my 6-year-old cousin and i wondered if cowry shells were truly fair -- i found nothing online, and decided to introduce him to the idea of using data to learn about the world!

we started documenting the result of every cowry shell roll, and he ended up loving it (or just the fact he got extra screen-time) and we ultimately collected 3,039 data points, which was unbelievable. i love this project because it helped me explain to a lot of my extended family what statistics even is, lol.

**what**: 
- ac.pdf: this short lil report includes the histogram and tables i created to help my cousin understand what we were doing. also includes a quick chi-square test i ran to confirm that our cowry shells (and likely others) are *not fair*
- ac.rmd: R Markdown file that created ac.pdf, includes all code
- ac_raw.txt: raw text file we collected data with
- ac.txt: cleaned up data

**skills**: 
- communication
- R (ggplot2)
- R Markdown
